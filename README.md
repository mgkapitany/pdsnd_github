for Udacity Programming for Data Science Nanodegree

### Date created
February 15, 2021

### Description
> "In this project, you will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. You will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. You will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics." - Udacity Project Page
